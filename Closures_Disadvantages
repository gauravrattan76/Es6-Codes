As long as closures are active, this memory cannot be garbage collected.


As long asclosures are active, this memory cannot be garbage collected. Therefore, closures can lead to memory leaks if not used well.

So to fix this in your program if there comes a point that youâ€™re done using an element inside the closure then you need to set it to null.

creating functions inside other functions lead to duplication in memory, potentially slowing down the application.

Unless you need privacy, its more practical to use the module pattern to create new objects with shared methods.
